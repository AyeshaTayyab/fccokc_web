    <p>
        Thinking about coming to your first freeCodeCamp Oklahoma meetup?
        <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've taken the first step on your journey, and we are glad to see you! Going
        to a meetup can be intimidating at first, but it doesn't have to be. You can get an idea of what to expect by
        watching past meetups on <a href="https://twitch.tv/techlahoma">Twitch</a> and
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdW0ayjzW_LC3r4TIg08APaJlgtI9t8BH">YouTube</a>.
        Also, here are some tips for attending your first meetup.
    </p>

    <h2>What Should I Bring?</h2>
    <p>Nothing is required. However, for in-person meetups, pen and paper or laptop for taking notes is recommended.</p>

    <h2>What To Do When Attending</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Show up a few minutes early to meet and network with people before the talk starts.</li>
        <li>Be polite and respectful</li>

            Keep the

        </li>
        <li>Feel free to bring any questions you might have to ask before or after the talks.</li>
        <li>Many of our talks are concept-based, and do not involve any coding</li>
        <li>Tip: <a href="/slack">Slack</a> is also a great place to ask other members your questions</li>
        <li>Network and act professionally, as many members could be future coworkers or employers</li>
        <li>
            The event space needs to be vacated promptly after our alotted time (generally 3:00pm). Feel free to carry
            on conversations outside of the event space or elsewhere
